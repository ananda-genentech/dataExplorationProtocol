# dataExplorationProtocol

After reading, "A protocol for data exploration to avoid common statistical problems", I created a spreadsheet that documented `intraconnections` I found 
throughout the paper. I define `intraconnections` as statements, methods, sub-arguments, concepts, etc. that the author mentions at one point in the 
paper that connects to another.I represent these `intraconnections` in one big network graph and break down the smaller parts of the network showing 
each topic and its intraconnections.

* `intraconViz.ipynb`: code to render network graph and subgraphs
* `intraconnections.csv`: file containing the different nodes (concepts) and their relationships to each other (`intraconnections`)
* `graphHTML.zip`: file containing all the sub-graphs for each node
* `network.html`: file containing thhe entire network for all the nodes
